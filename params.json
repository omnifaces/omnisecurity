{"name":"OmniSecurity","tagline":"Easy of use abstractions on top of Java EE security APIs","body":"## What is OmniSecurity?\r\n\r\nOmniSecurity provides a basic security (login) facility for simple, self-contained web applications with easy of use abstractions on top of Java EE security APIs like JASPIC and JACC.\r\n\r\nThe focus is on integrating with the Java EE security model and making the low-level security APIs that Java EE offers easier and more approachable. As such OmniSecurity is *not* a security framework itself, but merely a set of utilities for the existing Java EE security APIs.\r\n\r\nThis project takes advantage of the JASPIC/JASPI/JSR 196 SPI and aims among others at building a portable SAM (Server Authentication Module/Server Auth Module) that delegates the actual authentication (user name and role retrieval) to user code. It's an implementation of the ideas proposed in [JAVAEE_SPEC-9](http://java.net/jira/browse/JAVAEE_SPEC-9) and [JASPIC_SPEC-17](https://java.net/jira/browse/JASPIC_SPEC-17)\r\n\r\nOmniSecurity is a sub-project of [OmniFaces](http://omnifaces.org).  \r\nIt targets Java EE 7 exclusively and is build with JDK 7.  \r\nNote that this is still an *alpha* quality project at the moment.\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nMaven coordinates:\r\n\r\n```XML\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>org.omnifaces</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>omnifaces-security</artifactId>\r\n    <version>0.6-ALPHA</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Demo\r\n\r\nThe auth module is demonstrated in a [Java EE 6 kickoff app](https://github.com/javaeekickoff/java-ee-kickoff-app), which also has a [live demo](https://javaee6-kickoffapp.rhcloud.com).","google":"UA-29559297-8","note":"Don't delete this file!
