[OmniSecurity homepage is available at **omnisecurity.omnifaces.org**](http://omnisecurity.omnifaces.org).

**NOTE**

Core concepts of OmniSecurity have been standardised as [JSR 375](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=375) and reimplemented as [Soteria](https://github.com/javaee-security-spec/soteria).

This means OmniSecurity is now deprecated in favor of JSR 375/Soteria.
